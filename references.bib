  abstract = {Healthcare facility (HCF) location has attracted considerable attention from the operations research community over nearly four decades as one of the most important strategic issues in healthcare systems, disaster management, and humanitarian logistics. However, the lack of a comprehensive review in the last decade is a serious shortcoming in the literature of HCF location. This survey presents a framework to classify different types of non-emergency and emergency HCFs in terms of location management, and reviews the literature based on the framework. The papers on HCF location problems are classified in detailed tables along ten descriptive dimensions, which are consideration of uncertainty, multi-period setting, particular input/setting, objective function, decision variable, constraint, basic discrete location problem, mathematical modeling approach, solution method, and case study inclusion. For each HCF type, research gaps and possible future directions are identified. Moreover, the literature and future research possibilities are analyzed in terms of modeling approach and solution method.},

This paper applies Design Science Research methodology to explore how the IFC should be specified so that BIM actors can meet the representation context of a project translating data through Inheritance Diagrams, which offer auxiliary contributions. The Protocol developed to address the research problem revealed that some information requirements had not been met, as the universe of optional data in the schema is broad. Therefore, an artifact is created to fully meet the demand and is validated by different software. This reveals that the insertion of data can be performed to meet the desired interoperability and stands a valuable tool for BIM actors.},

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

  abstract = {A building design is typically created by a collaboration of professionals. Whilst the advent of BIM tools makes the assessment of the performance of an iterative design possible, these tools are not commonly used, due to traditional practice prevailing, technical limitations including differing data formats, and industry resistance to innovation. Timely consistent feedback throughout the design process, as major design decisions are made, could enable the enhancement of energy efficiency. However, current design guidelines are typically not in digital rule form, preventing the automated checking and validation of developing design models. Furthermore, architectural design tools have poor connections to thermal and environmental analysis software, which is exacerbated by a lack of knowledge of the data requirements of other disciplines both upstream and downstream. This paper explores the potential for embedding parameters within architectural model files to enable the enhancement of energy efficiency at the design stage and through the design process. It explores the architectural to energy analysis data exchanges, and demonstrates the way in which energy efficiency parameters can be embedded within model files to inform decision making at the conceptual design stage. The paper found that by using tools readily available, it is possible to add value during the design process through the use of BIM, with improved design outcomes as the result. The need to develop new workflows between the disciplines as a result of this different approach was highlighted. This enhanced practice is more responsive and can support better communication within project teams through providing timely information and feedback, providing analysis before optimisation for energy efficiency.},

We discuss several approaches of lifting modeling information that is based on the express family of languages for data modeling onto a logically rigid and semantically enhanced ontological level encoded in the W3C Ontology Web Language. We exemplify the added value of such formal notation of building models by providing several examples where generic query and reasoning algorithms can be applied to problems that otherwise have to be manually hard-wired into applications for processing building information. Furthermore, we show how the underlying resource description framework and the set of technologies evolving around it can be tailored to the need of distributed collaborative work in the building and construction industry.},

The results obtained show the feasibility of developing the proposed tool. However, inconsistencies between gbXML files from different BIM authoring tools were observed. There was a need for manual adjustments to the building information models before export to gbXML. This finding reinforces the need for the standardized implementation of exportation tools for open interoperability formats by software manufacturers. It also indicates the possibility for the future use of this tool to support the Brazilian energy labeling certification process and assist building designers in the early design stage.},

However, manual-based traditional EPA methods can cause serious problems, such as recurrent and error-prone data replication, data leaks, and redundant data processing and storage. Building information modeling (BIM), as an integrated repository of information about a particular building, has been applied to EPAs to overcome those problems. Although BIM has the potential to increase work efficiency in the assessment process, low interoperability between BIM data and energy simulation models raises huge barriers to reliable BIM-based EPAs. This research aims to improve the interoperability of BIM-based EPAs by developing an environment that contains a process, a materials library, and an EPA support system that connects BIM and energy modeling. To validate the suggested environment, we conducted a case study, and the results show that the proposed environment greatly contributes to increased accuracy and efficiency in the EPA with high interoperability.},

This review summarizes the main countries, areas, modeling tools, and interoperability strategies, with the advantages and disadvantages of each one. The methodology is based on the PRISMA protocol, and two databases were used for the research: Scopus and Google Scholar. A total of 532 publications were selected and 100 papers were deemed useful for the purposes of this review. The main findings led to the identification of four different interoperability strategies between BIM and BEM tools: (1) real-time connection; (2) standardized exchange formats and middleware corrective tools; (3) adherence to model view definitions; (4) proprietary tool-chain. These strategies were found to be characterized by different degrees of complexity, time required for information exchange, proprietary or opensource software, ability to reduce information loss, and detailed energy results. The results of this study showed that, to date, there is no better interoperability strategy, and that further efforts are needed so that interoperability between the two tools can become commonplace.},

It allows us to quantify and visualize the thematic evolution of a given research field. To do this, co-word analysis is used in a longitudinal framework in order to detect the different themes treated by the research field across the given time period. The performance analysis uses different bibliometric measures, including the h-index, with the purpose of measuring the impact of both the detected themes and thematic areas. The presented approach includes a visualization method for showing the thematic evolution of the studied field.Then, as an example, the thematic evolution of the Fuzzy Sets Theory field is analyzed using the two most important journals in the topic: Fuzzy Sets and Systems and IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The study outlines the state-of-art on interoperability between Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Building Performance Simulation (BPS). First, the paper organises the result of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the topic into three main strategies to achieve interoperability: the scripting to automate the information transfer between BIM and BPS environments, the pipelines supported by current practices, and the MVD and IFC schema extension approach. Software applications, types of files involved, building features, life cycle phases and model geometry considered by the literature along with reported interoperability issues, are also analysed. Secondly, an expert review of grey literature focusing on EU funded projects, guidelines, reports, best practices and key initiatives on the field of BIM to BPS interoperability is presented. The study wraps up by reporting on six major research trends identified by the review and highlighting future developments. The results of the review seem to indicate that effective interoperability can be achieved with the definition of a commonly accepted strategy, integrating shared guidelines for modelling, a better inclusion of energy evaluations through the whole life cycle of a building and the upgrade of software application for the accurate production of information with open format exchange files.}

  abstract = {Buildings are a main contributor to energy consumption, it accounts for approximately one-third of global energy use; therefore, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has become an emerging digital technology in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. There is a growing demand on applying BIM for low energy buildings including the building energy simulation (BES). However, there exist challenges for exchanging data and interoperability has caused barriers to utilize the information from BIM for BES. This paper explored the energy model accuracy of two different software including Autodesk Revit and DesignBuilder. The annual electricity consumption of the two programs were analyzed and compared to the actual measured consumption data of three typical residential building on different three locations including Cairo, Alexandria and Asyut. The outcomes suggest that comparisons may be made between building energy performance simulated data and measured data, nevertheless the outcomes might vary based on the human behavior patterns within the model. Additionally, the results show that DesignBuilder simulated data was close to actual data for the electricity consumption than the Revit however both programs were very close to the actual measured data.},

Since the 1970s the trend has been shifting from manufacturing to service industries. Due to their nature, service industries are frequently located in or near urban areas that results in additional assumptions, objectives and constraints other than those in more traditional manufacturing location models. This survey focuses on the location of service facilities in urban areas. We studied 110 research papers across different journals and disciplines. We have analyzed these papers on two levels. On the first, we take an Operations Research perspective to investigate the papers in terms of types of decisions, location space, main assumptions, input parameters, objective functions and constraints. On the second level, we compare and contrast the papers in each of these applications categories: (a) Waste management systems (WMS), (b) Large-scale disaster (LSD), (c) Small-scale emergency (SSE), (d) General service and infrastructure (GSI), (e) Non-emergency healthcare systems (NEH) and (f) Transportation systems and their infrastructure (TSI). Each of these categories is critically analyzed in terms of application, assumptions, decision variables, input parameters, constraints, objective functions and solution techniques. Gaps, research opportunities and trends are identified within each category. Finally, some general lessons learned based on the practicality of the models is synthesized to suggest avenues of future research.},

This study aims to review the current trends in the application of BIM in project cost management. Design/methodology/approach: This study systematically reviews the literature on the application of BIM in project cost management. A total of 46 related articles were identified and analyzed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method. Findings: Eighteen approaches to applying BIM in project cost management were identified. The approaches can be grouped into cost control and cost estimation. Also, BIM can be applied independently or integrated with other techniques. The integrated approaches for cost control include integration with genetic algorithms, Monte Carlo simulation, lean construction, integrated project delivery, neural network and value engineering. On the contrary, integrated approaches for cost estimation include integration with cost-plus pricing, discrepancy analysis, construction progress curves, estimation standards, algorithms, declarative mappings, life cycle sustainability assessment, ontology, Web-based frameworks and structured query language. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to systematically review prior literature on the application of BIM in project cost management. As a result, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the art and fills the literature gap. Researchers and industry professionals can use the study findings to increase the benefits of implementing BIM in construction projects. {\copyright} 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The BIM-BEM strategy avoids remodeling the building to create the BEM by exchanging architectural information to complete the energy analysis. However, most existing frameworks do not simultaneously describe the BIM-BEM process and related technical aspects to be followed during the design process. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive BIM-BEM framework initially created based on theoretical and field investigations and then enhanced by a trial investigation using a testing case. The proposed framework is illustrated in an easy-to-follow process map that includes work/data flows and specifies data exchangers and information requirements. The framework is validated using a complex case study to demonstrate its applicability for different BEM tools. The proposed framework intends to provide the industry with a useful and generic process for BIM-BEM that enables professionals to create proper BIM and BEM to complete energy analysis during the design process.},

The method of using building information modelling for the building energy modelling process, named building information modelling-based building energy modelling has become a prevalent and attractive topic in both the research and the industry society in recent years. This paper presents an overall review on the building design process, and applications of building information modelling and building energy modelling in the design process. It also provides an in-depth review on the development of building information modelling-based building energy modelling methods and the development of prevalent informational infrastructures. Meanwhile, this literature review provides a special consideration on the maturity of building data transformation between building information modelling and building energy modelling for building energy simulation process, from the step 1 identifying the geometry, thermal properties of buildings to the step 6 the information and components for HVAC systems. In general, the current building information modelling-based building energy modelling methods are thoroughly evaluated and the trends for future developments are outlined. It is realised that the Building Information Modelling based Building Energy Modelling is particular appropriate for the early design stage, where the most suitable and cost effective approaches for energy efficient design can be integrated into the overall building design process.},

A methodology for semiautomated BEP simulation model creation could make this process much more expedient and as such lower to threshold for the use of such models. Building Information Models (BIM) are an information-rich repository that could be used to streamline and expedite the collection of such information. Concerning the building geometry, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) can provide static building information that include geometric configuration and material properties, but in a form that might not be directly usable for the generation of thermal simulation models due to the absence of 2nd-level boundary information. In this paper, a three-step methodology for (semi-) automated generation of thermal simulation models is presented, including: A query on the building data model requesting geometry-related information; a processing of the acquired data by a 2nd-level boundary identification algorithm, the Common Boundary Intersection Projection (CBIP) algorithm; and a transformation stage that converts the geometry information of IFC, along with the data obtained from the CBIP algorithm, to an EnergyPlus and/or TRNSYS input file, with the latter being the main topic of this paper.},

They represent military facilities which have more criteria that need to be matched than civil structures. The proposed model is based on combined use of Geographic information systems (GIS) and multi-criteria techniques. The model application is presented in the case study of Carpathian region, the Eastern part of Serbia. The model deals with nine restrictions and six evaluation criteria. Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory---Analytic Network Process (DEMATEL-ANP) multi-criteria techniques are used to determine weight coefficients of evaluation criteria. Along with the above mentioned methods, this paper introduces a new technique for the multi-criteria decision making---MAIRCA (MultiAttributive Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis) method. The MAIRCA method is used for the ranking and selection of suitable locations. The results have shown that 45 km2 of the Carpathian region is very suitable for ammunition depot construction. The MAIRCA method chose location L1 as the most appropriate. Sensitivity analysis shows that the model is capable of identifying a suitable ammunition depot location. This approach can be helpful in determining suitable ammunition depot locations in other regions with similar geographic conditions and can also be successfully used for the suitability assessment of existing ammunition depots.},

  abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse---definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects---is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.}

In this research, semi-automatic validation is preferred to ensure the syntactic, semantic and technical correctness of link sets for the practical application of so-called linked building models. Therefore, rule validation approaches in the AEC industry are examined regarding their feasibility for linked building models.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) and standardized information delivery enable exchanging, storing, and linking cross-domain information bundled in containers such as the standardized Information Container for Linked Document Delivery (ICDD). While assessing the quality of the interlinking and metadata is essential to allow all parties to interpret an information container correctly, most research efforts have focused on code compliance of domain-specific models. In order to address this gap, this paper proposes an approach for validating ICDD information containers using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), the W3C recommendation for Resource Description Framework (RDF) data validation. For optimized querying and validation, a case study applies SHACL inference rules to the linking structure of ICDD to infer predicates between linked entities in four ICDD containers in varying dataset sizes and different linking methods. Afterward, the validation of these containers is analyzed using three types of validation rules with increasing complexity for another SHACL implementation. Results show the feasibility of cross-domain building information validation in ICDD with SHACL and how performance enhancements can be obtained on an inferred dataset compared to the original dataset.},

  abstract = {Some tasks in the construction industry and urban management field such as site selection and fire response management are usually managed by using a Geographical Information System (GIS), as the tasks in these processes require a high level and amount of integrated geospatial information. Recently, a key element of this integrated geospatial information to emerge is detailed geometrical and semantic information about buildings. In parallel, Building Information Models (BIMs) of today have the capacity for storing and representing such detailed geometrical and semantic information. In this context, the research aimed to investigate the applicability of BIMs in geospatial environment by focusing specifically on these two domains; site selection and fire response management. In the first phase of the research two use case scenarios were developed in order to understand the processes in these domains in a more detailed manner and to establish the scope of a possible software development for transferring information from BIMs into the geospatial environment. In the following phase of the research two data models were developed -- a Schema-Level Model View and a geospatial data model. The Schema-Level Model View was used in simplifying the information acquired from the BIM, while the geospatial data model acted as the template for creating physical files and databases in the geospatial environment. Following this, three software components to transfer building information into the geospatial environment were designed, developed, and validated. The first component served for acquiring the building information from the BIM, while the latter two served for transforming the information into the geospatial environment. The overall research demonstrated that it is possible to transfer (high level of geometric and semantic) information acquired from BIMs into the geospatial environment. The results also demonstrated that BIMs provide a sufficient level and amount of (geometric and semantic) information (about the building) for the seamless automation of data management tasks in the site selection and fire response management processes.},

These complex datasets contain a large amount and variety of information, ranging from design specifications to real-time sensor data. They are used by architects and engineers for various analysis and simulations throughout a facility's life cycle. Many techniques from different visualization fields could be used to analyze these data. However, the BIM domain still remains largely unexplored by the visualization community. The goal of this article is to encourage visualization researchers to increase their involvement with BIM. To this end, we present the results of a systematic review of visualization in current BIM practice. We use a novel taxonomy to identify main application areas and analyze commonly employed techniques. From this domain characterization, we highlight future research opportunities brought forth by the unique features of BIM. For instance, exploring the synergies between scientific and information visualization to integrate spatial and non-spatial data. We hope this article raises awareness to interesting new challenges the BIM domain brings to the visualization community.},

  abstract = {Buildings contribute to about 40\% of total annual energy consumption in the U.S. and saving a small percentage of that can lead to significant economic and environmental impacts. Building Energy Modeling (BEM) tools are important in reducing building's energy consumption. Most of the available tools only provide total energy consumption related to HVAC system, lighting, hot water, and appliances. While fine-grained data may be available in some computer tools, the process for obtaining these data is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires software-related skills. This paper explains a developed tool that contributes in automation of building energy simulation and providing fine-grained outputs by using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and modified source code of energy simulation tools such as EnergyPlus and OpenStudio. This tool, which is referred to as ABEMAT (Automated Building Energy Modeling and Assessment Tool), receives gbXML file and provides users with the amount of heat transfer through every single building envelope component such as windows, doors, and walls through an automated process. ABEMAT's and EnergyPlus advanced outputs are compared for validation; the latter being a time consuming process and error-prone, which requires software-related skills compared to ABEMAT. Results showed similar findings indicating the functionality of ABEMAT in providing fine-grained outputs.},

Using this proposition as a starting point, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the value of BIM and the challenges affecting its adoption in FM applications. Design/methodology/approach Two inter-related research methods are utilised. The literature is utilised to identify the application areas, value and challenges of BIM in FM. Due to the lack of case studies identified in the literature review, and to provide empirical evidence of the value and challenges of BIM in FM, a case study of Northumbria University's city campus, is used to empirically explore the value and challenges of BIM in FM. Findings The results demonstrated that BIM value in FM stems from improvement to current manual processes of information handover; improvement to the accuracy of FM data, improvement to the accessibility of FM data and efficiency increase in work order execution. The main challenges were the lack of methodologies that demonstrate the tangible benefits of BIM in FM, the limited knowledge of implementation requirement including BIM for FM modelling requirements, the interoperability between BIM and FM technologies, the presence of disparate operational systems managing the same building and finally, the shortage of BIM skills in the FM industry. Originality/value There is lack of real-life cases on BIM in FM especially for existing assets despite new constructions representing only 1-2 per cent of the total building stock in a typical year. The originality of this paper stems from both adding a real-life case study of BIM in FM and providing empirical evidence of both the value and challenges of BIM in FM applications.},

Semantic web ontologies have been developed for the AEC domain, but an ontology for describing the energy and mass flow between systems and components is missing. This study proposes the Flow Systems Ontology (FSO) for describing the composition of flow systems, and their mass and energy flows. Two example models are expressed using FSO vocabulary. SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) queries are performed to further demonstrate and validate the ontology. The main contribution consists of developing FSO as an ontology complementary to the existing ontologies. Finally, the paper introduces a roadmap for future developments building on FSO.},

When BIM data are imported into and exported from BIM authoring tools, the seamless sharing and consistent maintenance of BIM data throughout a building project require homogeneous BIM data exchange standards and robust validation frameworks. Several versions of the Industry Foundation Class (IFC) schema provide the schematic foundation of BIM data exchange standards. In addition, diverse disciplines have developed the Model View Definition (MVD), which refers to data exchange specifications defined as a subset of the IFC schema. However, BIM data validation against the requirements of the MVD and the limitations of this data evaluation process have not been thoroughly investigated, which results in syntactic problems, semantic errors, and unintended geometrical transformation. In an effort to address these issues, the research study involves the development of the MVD-based rule-checking features on the IfcDoc tool and includes the in-depth discussion of the complexity and challenges of BIM data validation following the Precast Concrete National BIM Standard. In addition, this paper describes identified knowledge regarding BIM data validation using the MVD relating to procedures, scope, and complexity, and includes the challenges and limitations of automated rule-based BIM data checking to which future researchers can refer in order to avoid revealed problems in their MVD development and evaluation processes.},

Although BIM provides engineers with building objects and their information that can be used in a variety of platforms for creating analytical models, the shared objects have often lost track of their identification in different models during model creation, design iterations, and model transformation processes. To address this, mapping algorithms that can interface BIM and analytical models (e.g., building energy models (BEM), structural analysis models) were developed in this paper by automatically mapping objects based on their invariant signatures. An experiment was conducted on mapping space objects between BIM and BEM following the proposed framework. The developed algorithm was tested on a 4-story office building model with 82 spaces. The results showed that the algorithm achieved 90\% precision and 90\% recall for mapping space objects. A 4.88\% improvement in the accuracy of energy simulation results was achieved through the algorithmic space mapping compared to that without space mapping. This research will contribute to filling informational gaps between BIM and analytical models. The proposed framework can also be used to further expand BIM interoperability support by providing a new data-driven approach for developing transformation algorithms.},

This paper presents a new knowledge model-based framework that incorporates the semantic information and SMM rules in BIM for automatic code-compliant QTO. It begins with domain knowledge modeling, taking into consideration QTO-related information, semantic QTO entities and relationships, and SMM logic formulation. Subsequently, linguistic-based approaches are developed to automatically audit the BIM model integrity for QTO purposes, with QTO algorithms developed and used in a case study for demonstration. The results indicate that the proposed new framework automatically identifies the semantic errors in BIM models and obtains code-compliant quantities.},

The traditional object-oriented approach has difficulties in representing unstructured BIM data (e.g., interrelationships), while rule-based methods involve tremendous human efforts to develop rule sets, lacking flexibility for different requirements. Therefore, this study aims to establish a novel data-driven framework based on BIM and knowledge graph (KG) to represent unstructured BIM data for automatic inferences of auditing results of BIM model mistakes. It starts by establishing a BIM-KG data model via identifying required information for auditing purposes. Subsequently, BIM data is automatically transformed into the BIM-KG representations, the embeddings of which are trained using a knowledge graph embedding model. Automatic mechanisms are then developed to utilize the computable embeddings to effectively identify mistake BIM elements. The framework is validated using illustrative examples and the results show that 100\% mistake elements can be identified successfully without human intervention.},

There is a need to establish an up-to-date synthesis on the current status of information exchange and interoperability between BIM and FM systems. After an in-depth review of 113 journal articles published from 2008 to 2018, this study systematically presents (1) a holistic review and critical reflection on the current status of BIM implementation in FM with a focus on information exchange and interoperability, (2) research trends and patterns and (3) research gaps and a future agenda in this area. Through a bibliometric and content review analysis, this paper concludes that the process of information exchange between BIM models and FM systems is not a straightforward process, as software interoperability remains a significant challenge. Bridging this gap requires standardized practical processes to integrate different information sources related to maintenance management, health \& safety management tasks and BIM data, to provide a rich semantic database to support FM systems. Finally, it is hoped that this paper will advocate further developing a seamless information exchange process between BIM and FM systems to overcome interoperability issues and facilitate BIM implementation in FM.},

This study highlights the crucial connection between design processes and energy efficiency by encouraging the exploration of BIM as a methodological approach. Moreover, there is a need to develop standardized guidelines for BIM modeling, enhanced OpenBIM tools to improve interoperability, and the exploration of ontologies and machine learning for optimized data exchange. The research recommends a broader approach to address technical aspects for successfully integrating BIM in building energy assessments within the Brazilian context.},

Furthermore, the construction industry is one of that presents a considerable environmental impact as it consumes large amounts of natural resources and energy. Aiming to investigate the environmental impacts, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology evaluates products and services showing the similarities and differences in evaluating midpoint and endpoint impact categories. This study reviews LCA from a building perspective and empowers the decision-making process and sustainable building design in the construction sector. The novelty is to estimate the operating energy performance and evaluate the endpoint impacts of building materials at an early designing stage, considering two methods of construction; concrete construction and steel construction. This work follows the methodological framework of LCA based on ISO 14040 and 14044 guidelines within the available database, using Autodesk Green Building Studio application in Autodesk Revit and Open LCA software based on two assessment methods: IMPACT 2002+ and ILCD 2011. A case study of a multi-story office building is applied to achieve the objectives of this work. The building is structured at four levels of subsystems and associated construction materials: basic structure, walls, finishing, and windows. Results indicate that using steel construction instead of concrete construction is more environmentally friendly in such types of buildings. It encourages the application of innovative techniques in the production process to protect natural resources, reduce energy consumption, and protecting the built environment.},

  abstract = {In the recent years, the interest to knowledge extraction in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) domain has grown dramatically. Along with the advances in the AEC domain, a massive amount of data is collected from sensors, project management software, drones and 3D scanning. However, the construction regulatory knowledge has maintained primarily in the form of unstructured text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been recently introduced to the construction industry to extract underlying knowledge from unstructured data. For instance, NLP can be used to extract key information from construction contracts and specifications, identify potential risks, and automate compliance checking. It is considered impractical for construction engineers and stakeholders to author formal, accurate, and structured building regulatory rules. However, previous efforts on extracting knowledge from unstructured text in AEC domain have mainly focused on basic concepts and hierarchies for ontology engineering using traditional NLP techniques, rather than deeply digging in the nature of the used NLP techniques and their abilities to capture semantics from the building regulations text. In this context, this paper focuses on the development of a semantic-based testing approach that studies the performance of modern NLP techniques, namely word embeddings and transformers, on extracting semantic regularities within the building regulatory text. Specifically, this paper studies the ability of word2vec, BERT, and Sentence BERT (SBERT) to extract semantic regularities from the British building regulations at both word and sentence levels. The UK building regulations code has been used as a dataset. The ground truth of semantic regulations has been manually curated from the well-established Brick Ontology to test the performance of the proposed NLP techniques to capture the semantic regularities from the building regulatory text. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses have been performed, and the obtained results show that modern NLP techniques can reliably capture semantic regularities from the building regulations text at both word and sentence levels, with an accuracy that reaches 80\% at the word-level, and hits 100\% at the sentence-level.},

Interoperability smooths communication while increasing information management quality. The aim of this paper is to investigate the interoperability research gaps and trends in Building Information Modeling (BIM) for architecture, engineering, construction, operation, and facility management (AECO/FM). This study adopted a holistic approach with a bibliometric search, a scientometric mapping and analysis of interoperability in BIM research. Data about interoperability in BIM were collected through an examination of 477 articles that were selected from the Scopus database. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by highlighting the research trend and gaps in key areas, and their relationship with interoperability in BIM. As results suggest, future studies should focus on interoperability in BIM to increase knowledge-integrated, ontology-based, IT-based managed, collaborative, automated, well-visualized, and sustainable outcomes throughout the project lifecycle.},

Other governments, including Australia, with a national map of 2D map information have not yet provided GIS-based open data and open application programming interfaces (APIs). On the other hand, the Korean government has actively opened up GIS-based information called VWorld and open APIs. However, the building industry has not yet exploited this information, and it seems to lack accessibility. Therefore, authors aim to support fast and expanding open data and propose a middleware that uses VWorld as a target platform for searching, processing, and generating GIS-based open data toward realizing building information modelling (BIM) exchangeable information. A Web 2.0 based middleware should be different from a Web 1.0 counterpart so that open data from suppliers are guided and delivered to data consumers in customized data formats. Authors expect that this study will serve as a general guiding approach for harvesting GIS-based open data as soon as other governments provide open data in the near future. Therefore, it should lead to dramatic improvements in acquiring environmental information relevant to building design, thus enabling better decision-making during design.},

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of an EXPRESS-to-OWL converter and the key features of the resulting ifcOWL ontology.},

The argument for such a semantic rule checking process has been made a number of times by now. However, there are a number of strategies and approaches that can be followed regarding the realization of such a rule checking process, even when limiting to the use of semantic web technologies. In this article, we compare three reference rule checking approaches that have been reported earlier for semantic rule checking in the domain of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). Each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. A criterion that is tremendously important to allow adoption and uptake of such semantic rule checking approaches, is performance. Hence, this article provides an overview of our collaborative test results in order to obtain a performance benchmark for these approaches. In addition to the benchmark, a documentation of the actual rule checking approaches is discussed. Furthermore, we give an indication of the main features and decisions that impact performance for each of these three approaches, so that system developers in the construction industry can make an informed choice when deciding for one of the documented rule checking approaches.},

By deploying the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a description language, these systems offer building information in a widely interoperable format, so that several applications are able to infer extra information.

Existing semantic web technology may be able to overcome these limitations, thereby enabling a range of significant improvements and possibilities for automation in building design and construction. This paper gives a short overview of the functionality of IFC as a language, compared to the functionality of languages deployed in the semantic web domain. The improvements generated by deploying semantic web languages are briefly discussed, after which a concrete implementation approach is presented for a semantic rule checking environment for building design and construction. An implemented test case for acoustic performance checking illustrates the improvements of such an environment compared to traditionally deployed approaches in rule checking.},

Yet, human skills are often essential when it comes to validating these requirements, which can be error-prone and contributes to the loss of information in the information stream of a project. As has been indicated before, higher levels of automation can be achieved by describing, querying, and validating AEC project data using the technology stack offered by the Semantic Web (SW). Particularly the logical basis of these technologies (semantic rule-checking) is promising, as it allows a more consistent representation and checking of such requirements. As part of the development of a decentralized rule-checking system using SW open standards, this study investigates particularly to what extent the more challenging requirements can be checked, such as 3D geometric requirements and more ambiguous or vague requirements. Tangible and clear results described in this report are (1) a concise classification of rule types that apply to BIM models, (2) a system architecture for a semantic rule-checking system, and (3) a demonstration of this system through three use cases. The results show how 66\% of a document containing human-readable requirements can be validated automatically. Furthermore, a clear indication is given of how the semantic compliance check can be combined with 3D geometric compliance checks into a scalable web-friendly architecture.},

The methodology leverages a collection of use cases to initiate the identification of exchange requirements needed by BEPS tools. The IDM/MVD framework captures and translates exchange requirements into the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema. The suggested approach aims to facilitate the transfer of information from IFC based BIM to either conventional or advanced BEPS tools (e.g. EnergyPlus and Modelica) through the development of a specific MVD that defines a subset of the IFC data model that deals with building energy performance simulation. By doing so, the potential of BIM-based simulation can be fully unlocked, and a reliable and consistent IFC subset is provided as an input for energy simulation software.},

Building professionals are increasingly expected to improve energy performance of their design. To achieve a high level of energy performance, multidisciplinary simulation-based optimization can be utilized to help designers in exploring more design alternatives and making informed decisions. Because of the high complexity in setting up a building model for multi-objective design optimization, there is a great demand of utilizing and integrating the advanced modeling and simulation technologies, including BIM, parametric modeling, cloud-based simulation, and optimization algorithms, as well as a new user interface that facilitates the setup of building parameters (decision variables) and performance fitness functions (design objectives) for automatically generating, evaluating, and optimizing multiple design options. This paper presents an integrated framework for building information modeling (BIM)-based performance optimization, BPOpt. This framework enables designers to explore design alternatives using an open-source, visual programming user interface on the top of a widely used BIM platform, to generate models of building design options, assess the environmental performance of the models through cloud-based simulation, and search for the most appropriate design alternatives. This paper details the process of the development of BPOpt and also provides a case study to show its application. The case study demonstrates the use of BPOpt in minimizing the energy consumption while maximizing the appropriate daylighting level for a residential building. Finally, strengths, limitations, current adoption by academia and industry, and future improvements of BPOpt for high-performance building design are discussed.},

  abstract = {The technological tools people use for designing buildings have progressed from drawings to descriptive geometry, and from computer-aided drafting and design (CAD) to building information modelling (BIM). Yet despite their use of state-of-the-art BIM technology, the multidisciplinary teams that design modern buildings still face numerous challenges. Building models lack sufficient semantic content to properly express design intent, concurrent design is difficult due to the need for operators to maintain model consistency and integrity manually, managing design variations is cumbersome due to the packaging of information in files, and collaboration requires making-do with imperfect interoperability between application software. In response, we propose a `Cloud BIM' (CBIM) approach to building modelling that seeks to automate maintenance of consistency across federated discipline-specific models by enriching models with semantic information that encapsulates design intent. The approach requires a new ontology to represent knowledge about the relationships between building model objects within and across disciplines. Discipline-specific building models are stored together with their data schema in knowledge graphs, and linked using objects and relationships from the CBIM ontology. The links are established using artificially intelligent semantic enrichment methods that recognize patterns of location, geometry, topology and more. Software methods that operate along CBIM relationship chains can detect inconsistencies that arise across disciplines and act to inform users, propose meaningful corrections, and apply them if approved. Future CBIM systems may provide designers with the functionality for collaborative multidisciplinary design by maintaining model consistency and managing versioning at the object level.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a location selection problem for a military airport using multiple criteria decision making methods. A real-world decision problem is presented and the decision criteria to evaluate alternative locations are specified. The objective is to identify the best location among candidate locations. Nine main criteria and thirty-three sub-criteria are identified by taking into account not only requirements for a military airport such as climate, geography, infrastructure, security, and transportation but also its environmental and social effects. The criteria weights are determined using AHP. Ranking and selection processes of four alternatives are carried out using PROMETHEE and VIKOR methods. Furthermore, the results of PROMETHEE and VIKOR methods are compared with the results of COPRAS, MAIRCA and MABAC methods. All methods suggest the same alternative as the best and produce the same results on the rankings of the location alternatives. One-way sensitivity analysis is carried out on the main criteria weights for all methods. Statistically significant correlations are observed between the rankings of the methods. Therefore, it is concluded that PROMETHEE, VIKOR, COPRAS, MAIRCA and MABAC methods can be successfully used for location selection problems and in general, for other types of multi-criteria decision problems with finite number of alternatives.},

  abstract = {The Plan of Construction Operations (PCO) subsidizes the fulfillment of the cost, term and the expected quality of the work. These have a direct influence on the productivity obtained at the construction site, since information flaw from the generated documentation is interpreted as the main cause-and-effect factor associated with low productivity, waste of materials and workmanship, resulting in poor quality of the final product. The use of Building Information Modeling in civil construction has been proposed as a technological solution for such problems. When BIM is associated with PCO it is recurrent to use the term 4D BIM or 4D modeling. In this way, this article seeks to clarify how to develop the use of 4D BIM for PCO and what benefits and difficulties arise. The issue was addressed through a Systematic Literature Review. Activity sequencing was identified for the development of BIM-based PCO and associated tooling. The main difficulties encountered were associated with the implementation process and the laborious and intense process of 3D modeling required and the disciplined integration with the work schedule. However, 4D BIM for PCO is feasible, showing benefits in providing optimization guidelines for the traditional PCO process, providing solutions for most of the problems inherent in the conventional method, as well as contributing to the reduction of rework through interoperability, integration of communication systems and simulation of the construction process.},

In such environments, it is valuable to utilise the vast amount of data contained within the building information models to improve access control administration. The use of building information models in access control scenarios can provide 3D visualisation of buildings as well as many other advantages such as automation of essential tasks including path finding, consistency detection, and accessibility verification. However, there is no mathematical model for building information models that can be used to describe and compute these functions. In this paper, we show how graph theory can be utilised as a representation language of building information models and the proposed security related functions. This graph-theoretic representation allows for mathematically representing building information models and performing computations using these functions.},

The paper is based on a review of current industry trends and issues with BIM implementation and detailed interviews with quantity surveying firms in Australia. BIM involves more than just 3D modelling and is also commonly defined in further dimensions such as 4D (time), 5D (cost) and even 6D (as-built operation). 4D links information and data in the 3D object model with project programming and scheduling data and facilitates the simulation analysis of construction activities. 5D integrates all of this information with cost data such as quantities, schedules and prices. 6D represents the as-built model that can then be used during the operational stages of the facility. This paper explores the importance for project cost management professionals to be integrally involved across all project phases and to embrace the 5th dimension to become key players in the BIM environment -- the `5D Project Cost Manager'. The literature review and industry interviews will examine the issues associated with this and will identify leading edge best practices in the field by professional project cost management firms. The paper concludes with the findings that the greatest value with the modern day project cost manager lies in their ability to be 5D literate and to be able to utilise electronic models to provide detailed 5D estimates and living cost plans in real time.},

  abstract = {Automated rule checking has been identified as potentially providing significant value to the AEC industry from both regulatory and industry perspectives. Key challenges to a successful rule checking implementation are the complexities inherent in the rules themselves and the breadth of conditions to which they need to apply. Due to the large number of building codes and theoretically infinite number of rules that can be defined, it is critical to systematize the rules to make the task of rule checking tractable. This paper is a first step towards classifying automated rule checking. In this paper, the authors draw upon their extensive international exposure with various building codes and rule checking areas in the AEC domain to introduce a general classification of rules across application domains using criteria that apply to all known aspects of automated rule checking. The exposure covers both academic research as well as actual production implementation done with CORENET ePlanCheck project in Singapore, and also various pilot implementations in the US and other countries. The authors offer a survey of representative examples of different classes of rules, their key concepts, potential tools required to implement them, and at least one possible solution of each example rule in each category. The examples are drawn from both research domains and existing commercial applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an initial guide for creating a framework for rule classification that articulates both the process challenges and the technology needs to address rule automation.},

A system like Building Information Modeling (BIM) has benefited many construction players in order to expedite their works effectively and efficiently in terms of design, implementation, and management of a project. As the construction industry involves many players such as clients, designers, contractors, and manufacturers, the existence of BIM can speed up planning time, minimizing resources, and even saving project costs. However, in some countries, the acceptance of BIM technology in the construction industry is still very low. This paper aims to explore and review the barriers associating with adopting BIM as a digital information tool in the construction industry. A systematic review was conducted of 26 journal articles and conference papers published between 2013 to 2019. The identified barriers were then classified and analyzed. The results of the study revealed that from the 26 selected articles, 15 categories of barriers have been successfully extracted and discussed. 15 categories of barriers are cost, law, experts, interoperability, awareness, culture, processes, management, demand, project scale, technology, skills, training, contract, and standard. The study offers significant insights for future research to overcome the barriers to the implementation of BIM.},

  abstract = {Green Building XML (gbXML) is one of the most prevalent data models used for Building Information Modeling (BIM). It enables interoperability between BIM and Building Energy Modeling (BEM). BEM is often used in building performance analysis software tools. However, through interviewing engineers and building energy modeling professionals in the industry, it turned out that most gbXML files are only used for importing and exporting building geometry information. Information such as Heating, Ventilation, and Ait-conditioning (HVAC) systems and internal loads are rarely handled due to the lack of functionality in current BIM software. Taking account of more than 15\% of the total energy consumption in the US is used by HVAC systems (DOE 2011), it is crucial to enable seamless HVAC data exchange between BIM software and BEM software. This paper researched the definition rules of HVAC systems in the current gbXML schema 6.01 version. Firstly, through a detailed data mapping of ASHRAE baseline HVAC system from IDF data model (EnergyPlus version 9.0) to current gbXML schema (version 6.01), interoperability issues were discovered and were concluded into three catecgories: missing components, overlapping components, and complex data mapping rules. Secondly, through redefining data mapping rules of current gbXML schema in terms of HVAC systems, the ASHRAE baseline HVAC system is able to be coded as a gbXML file. Finally, the gbXML file will be validated through a translation case study, focusing on primary HVAC system and boiler data. Revit 2020.1 Architecture is used in this study as the BIM tool. OpenStudio 2.8.1 and EnergyPlus 9.1.0 are used as the BEM tools. They are open-source and cross-platform, being adopted by lots of mainstream building performance analysis software. Based on the result of this study, current gbXML schema version 6.01 is capable of defining HVAC systems data, but the data mapping rules need to be documented and presented. Missing components and overlapping components issue could be solved by updating the schema. Interoperability improvement will eliminate the duplicate generation of HVAC data and allows a bidirectional information update between BIM and BEM software tools, supporting a more accurate and efficient building performance analysis process.  2020 Amer.

Therefore, all those involved in built environment issues should be able to access and share not only building information but also data about products, especially environmental assessment results for the products used in building projects. Of the several approaches that have been proposed to achieve efficient information exchange, semantic web technologies are amongst the most promising due to their capability to share data and enhance interoperability between the most heterogeneous systems. This study proposes an approach that can be used to make environmental data available in the early phases of the building lifecycle. It relies on Semantic Web techniques, especially Linked Data principles, while building on emerging Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology to propose an approach that facilitates information exchange to enhance the sustainability assessment of buildings. The paper ends with an illustration of how lifecycle inventory databases can be integrated, linked to BIM software and used in exchanging environmental building data.},

  abstract = {Reliable construction project cost estimation relies on accurate quantity takeoffs (QTOs), traditionally done with error-prone 2-D drawings, but the emergence of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has improved QTO speed, accuracy, and reliability. However, the quality of BIM models can influence quantity accuracy, an aspect often overlooked in research on automating QTO with BIM. This paper develops an integrated framework to automatically extract and visualize construction quantities from BIM models. The system includes a Quantity Precision Check (QPC) module for automating more accurate QTO outputs. These outputs are then automatically transferred to an external database and visualized through a user-friendly dashboard on the Microsoft Power BI platform. This dashboard allows for comparisons between 2-D and BIM quantities and helps track changes in quantities over time due to design changes. The system was successfully validated in an infrastructure construction project in Canada, where it identified a 39\% inconsistency in wall elements' material quantities and reduced steel quantity by 10\% due to design changes. Overall, the system offers a speedy, reliable, and efficient tool for construction estimators, site managers, and cost control teams to provide accurate quantities to the procurement team and make swift decisions in response to design change impacts on construction costs.},

  abstract = {The digitalisation of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction domain introduced new methods for digital collaboration, i.e. Building Information Modelling (BIM). While this method focuses on building data, the distribution of digital product models is still problematic, complicating uniform product searches and automated product data processing. Existing schemas, such as a subpart of the Industry Foundation Classes or the German VDI 3805, rely on rigid or template-driven schemas, that do not support the description of innovative or multi-functional products or impose a large schema overhead and complexity on manufacturers. Therefore, this article combines flexible and modular product descriptions with Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data. By applying Web-based technologies, the searchability of product data and the applicability of distributed data are expected to be enhanced. More precisely, this article proposes a concept for Linked Building Product Data and introduces the generic Building Product Ontology as a potential core schema of the concept. To demonstrate the feasibility of Linked Building Product Data and the Building Product Ontology, the authors apply both the concept and the data schema to innovative and multi-functional example products that cannot be described with the existing approaches for product descriptions. The evaluation demonstrates the flexibility, modularity and overall suitability of the presented concepts, meeting all collected requirements for digital product descriptions. Hence, Linked Building Product Data may solve existing issues with rigid product description schemas. At the same time, this approach complements the current research trend of Linked Building Data.},

Our approach involves machine learning and rule-based methods for object classification, relationship determination (e.g., hosting and adjacent) and attribute computation. The enriched results are compiled into a BIM graph. A case study was conducted to illustrate the approach for facilitating interoperability between different versions of the BIM authoring software Autodesk Revit. First, pure object geometries of an architectural apartment model were exported from Revit 2023 and fed into the developed tools in sequence to generate a BIM graph. Then, essential information was extracted from the graph and used to reconstruct an architectural model in the version 2022 of Revit. Upon examination, the reconstructed model was consistent with the original one. The success of this experiment demonstrates the feasibility of generating a BIM graph from object geometries and utilizing it to support interoperability.},

Cloud-based BIM (CBIM) proposes an alternative approach, in which BIM models are stored as discipline-specific graphs whose nodes are linked to support across-domain coordination. This work presents a theoretical basis for systematic consistency maintenance by 1) defining constraint classes to relate objects across disciplines and 2) devising a mechanism to resolve conflicts. A case study prototype was implemented with federated building models to demonstrate the system's response to design changes made by one discipline that impact others. It detects conflicts that violate design intent, and in simple cases, such as translations, it can resolve inconsistencies by actively propagating corrections subject to users' approvals. The prototype demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and strengthens the growing understanding that linked graphs with meaningful relationships can open the door to intelligent applications across BIM disciplines.},

  abstract = {As a new and important technology in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC), Building Information Modeling (BIM) has witnessed a decade of rapid development. It is highly necessary to analyze the research progress and development trend of BIM. Based on 1369 relevant literatures published and the core database ``Web of Science'', this study used co-citation analysis, co-word analysis, and cluster analysis to analyze the data and drew the mapping knowledge domains with Citespace software. The results show that BIM research is still in the rapid growth stage. And BIM research is mainly distributed in nine fields. In terms of time sequence, the development of BIM in the past decade developed from data collection to information integration and to knowledge management. The research hotspots are mainly concentrated in eleven directions, which can be further classified into three levels. This paper will provide valuable theoretical and practical reference for the future research of BIM.},

  abstract = {The innovation of building information modelling (BIM) technology provides a new means of predicting, managing and monitoring the environmental impacts of project construction and development through virtual prototyping/visualisation technology. This paper aims to provide thought-provoking insights into the shortcomings in the scope of the existing green BIM literature, and outlines the most important directions for future research. A total of 84 green-BIM-related papers have been reviewed and compared. Most green BIM research, centres on environmental performance at the design (44 papers) and construction stages (25 papers) of building lifecycles. Few studies concentrated on the development of BIM-based tools for managing environmental performance during the building maintenance, retrofitting (8 papers), and demolition (12 papers) stages. It is suggested that a `one-stop-shop' BIM for environmental sustainability monitoring and management over a building's full life cycle should be considered in future research. Future green BIM tools should also include the three R's concept (reduce, reuse and recycle) in their sustainability analysis for both new development and retrofitting projects. The system should offer better integration with facility operation maintenance manuals for more effective low-carbon management. The use of cloud-based BIM technology to enable the management of building sustainability using `big data' is also needed. Despite these potential developments, it is argued that the lack of computer tools and the complications of the BIM models are hindering the adoption of green BIM.},

  abstract = {Geographical areas have diverse green energy resources and different levels of energy consumptions. An important challenge to satisfy the energy demand using green energy resources is to balance energy supply and demand. Territory design deals with the problem of grouping geographic areas into larger geographic clusters called territories in such a way that the grouping is acceptable according to a planning criterion. The aim of this study is to group geographic areas so that energy requirement in a geographic cluster matches the available green energy potential in the same cluster. In this way, investments may be supported through region specific policies. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model. A location-allocation approach is employed to solve the model. The location and allocation problems are solved iteratively. In order to solve the initial location problem, a Genetic Algorithm is developed to find the results of the p-median problem. Then, the allocation problem is solved optimally using the ILOG Cplex solver. The territory design problem is solved for Turkey and the results of various numbers of territories are compared. Among those trials, 10 territories result in the best balance of demand and supply.},

  abstract = {Interoperability remains the key problem in multi-discipline collaboration based on building information modeling (BIM). Although various methods have been proposed to solve the technical issues of interoperability, such as data sharing and data consistency; organizational issues, including data ownership and data privacy, remain unresolved to date. These organizational issues prevent different stakeholders from sharing their data due to concerns regarding losing control of the data. This study proposes a multi-server information-sharing approach on a private cloud after analyzing the requirements for cross-party collaboration to address the aforementioned issues and prepare for massive data handling in the near future. This approach adopts a global controller to track the location, ownership and privacy of the data, which are stored in different servers that are controlled by different parties. Furthermore, data consistency conventions, parallel sub-model extraction, and sub-model integration with model verification are investigated in depth to support information sharing in a distributed environment and to maintain data consistency. Thus, with this approach, the ownership and privacy of the data can be controlled by its owner while still enabling certain required data to be shared with other parties. Application of the multi-server approach for information interoperability and cross-party collaboration is illustrated using a real construction project of an airport terminal. Validation shows that the proposed approach is feasible for maintaining the ownership and privacy of the data while supporting cross-party data sharing and collaboration at the same time, thus avoiding possible legal problems regarding data copyrights or other legal issues.},

  abstract = {Efficient information search from building information models (BIMs) requires deep BIM knowledge or extensive engineering efforts for building natural language (NL)-based interfaces. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a dynamic prompt-based virtual assistant framework dubbed ``BIMS-GPT'' that integrates generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technologies, supporting NL-based BIM search. To understand users' NL queries, extract relevant information from BIM databases, and deliver NL responses along with 3D visualizations, a dynamic prompt-based process was developed. In a case study, BIMS-GPT's functionality is demonstrated through a virtual assistant prototype for a hospital building. When evaluated with a BIM query dataset, the approach achieves accuracy rates of 99.5\% for classifying NL queries with incorporating 2\% of the data in prompts. This paper contributes to the advancement of effective and versatile virtual assistants for BIMs in the construction industry as it significantly enhances BIM accessibility while reducing the engineering and training data prerequisites for processing NL queries.},
